## Setup to Run the Application

**_Create a virtual environment_**: It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of the Flask application. In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv myenv
```

This command will create a new directory named "myenv" that will contain the virtual environment.

**_Activate the virtual environment_**: Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command based on your operating system:

For Windows:

```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS/Linux:

```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

After activation, you should see "(myenv)" at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating that you are working inside the virtual environment.

**_Run Plant Leaf Disease Detection System application_**: Once the dependencies are installed and any necessary environment variables are set, you can run the Flask application. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the main application file (app.py or similar) is located. Run the following command to start the Flask application:

```
flask run
```

Or

```
python app.py
```

The Flask application should now start running locally. You can access it by visiting http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

## DATA SOURCE üìä

- [Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset)

## Further Improvements üìà

As my initial major project, there are many areas where enhancements can be made.

- The CSS code is quite disorganized, with a mix of code within files and inline.
- Frontend can be made more intriguing.
- More data can be collected manually via web scrapping to make the system more accurate.
- Additional plant images can be collected to make the disease detection part more robust and generalized.
- Modularized code can be written instead of writing in Jupyter Notebooks.
